# ENSEIRB IT310

This repository will host all the materials I'll use during the courses I will provide to students engineers at [ENSEIRB](http://enseirb-matmeca.fr/).

Students _(or whoever is interrested)_ will find here organized by year:

* slides used during courses
* problems & exercices _(and probably a potential solution)_
